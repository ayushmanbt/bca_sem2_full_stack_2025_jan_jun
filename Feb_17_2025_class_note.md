## Introduction to bootstrap

**What is bootstrap?**

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is one of the most popular CSS framework which gives us predefined utility classes and components

**Why bootstrap?**

It gives us some base sensible CSS classes and element designs which makes making elements easier

**Why not bootstrap (or any other framework)?**

A lot of bootstrap pages look really similar and the use of bootstrap is easily recognizable in those pages. So if you want more control over your style and want an unique look in your webpage then don't use bootstrap

**How to use bootstrap?**

Include the CSS and JS for bootstrap with the following lines of code -

(For theory exam you don't need to remember these URLs, but you can just say include bootstrap CSS)

```html
<!-- Include this inside head -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- Include this inside body -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

**Why do we require JS with Bootstrap?**

There are some components like carasoul, dialogs, navbar etc. which need some JS to work properly. 

**Are there other CSS frameworks?**

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is one of the other popular CSS framework. It is a bit harder to set up.

## Strive to be better - try these challenges

1. Try to implement all the given buttons in bootstrap using normal HTML and CSS (should not be that difficult). Reference the buttons from this page - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/ Try the **Variants** and the **Outline buttons** ones.

2. Try to play with bootstrap a bit on your own, use the components. The documentation is your friend -
