# Class notes for 8th January 2025

- We learnt about a few more HTML Tags
- There are mainly two kinds of list in HTML
    - `<ul></ul>` Unordered List - bulleted list 
    - `<ol></ol>` Ordered List - numbered list
- We use `<li></li>` to add list items to the list
- (Did not mention in class on 8th) we can change the type of Unordered and ordered list with the type attribute as following -
    - With Unordered list we have the following types - disc(default), circle, square
    - With Ordered list we have the following types - 1(default), i, I, a, A
- We use anchor `<a></a>` tags to create hyperlinks. We use the href attribute to add the link where the page should go.
    - we can use the attribute `target="_blank"` to open the target of the link in a new tab
    - `<a href="link to page" target="_blank">Hello (The text shown for the link)</a>`
- We can use button elements for interactivity based on clicks `<button>Hey</button>`
- Semantic tags in HTML tells us about the content -
    - `<nav></nav>` navbar
    - `<header></header>` header section (not talked in class)
    - `<footer></footer>` footer element
    - `<aside></aside>` sidebar
    - `<main></main>` main content (not mentioned in class)
    - `<section></section>` section of a page
- (A bit mistake in the class) Non semantic tags in HTML tell us nothing about the content and function just as a wrapper -
    - `<div></div>`
    - `<span></span>`
