`* Selector:` Targets all HTML elements on the page. It applies the specified styles universally to every element.

`box-sizing: border-box;`: Ensures the width and height of elements include padding and borders, making layout calculations simpler and more predictable.


`:hover Pseudo-class`: Applies styles to an element when the user hovers their mouse pointer over it.
Example:

```
button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

This changes the button's background to blue when hovered over.

``cursor: pointer:`` Changes the mouse cursor to a hand icon (üñ±Ô∏èüëâ) when hovering over an element, signaling it is clickable.

```
button {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Commonly used for buttons, links, and other interactive elements.

`transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;:` Smoothly animates changes to the background-color over 0.3 seconds, starting slow (ease-in) and ending slow (ease-out).
